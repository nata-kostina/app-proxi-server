# app-proxi-server
 The purpose of the project is to develop a software tool that implements the functions of a proxy server. This software tool will allow you to monitor user activity on the Internet and block access to certain sites. 
### Description ###
The program consists of three classes.

The Program.cs class contains one static function, Main, which creates the program's main window object.

The Form1.cs class displays the main program window and contains event handlers that occur when working with the form.

The Server.cs class contains functions that implement the proxy server.
